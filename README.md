## 🌐 What is AWS?
AWS (Amazon Web Services) is a cloud srevice provider offered by Amazon. It provides a wide range of services like storage, servers, databases, networking, machine learning, security, and much more — all over the internet (the "cloud"), we can access these services anytime and anywhere

🧠 In Simple Words:
AWS lets you run websites, apps, store data, analyze information, and even train AI models — without needing to buy or manage physical hardware.

You pay only for what you use, just like electricity or water.
